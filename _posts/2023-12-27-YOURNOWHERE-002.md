# Predicting impact, an idea for positive-sum predictions.


**Magic Sauce for Future Predictions**

Ever tried fortune-telling with a touch of magic sauce? It's like predicting the future, but with a dash of extra flavor.

**Prediction Markets: A Money Dance**

Prediction markets are cool, but they're a bit like a game of winners and losers. Someone gains a dollar, someone loses a dollar, and it's a bit like a money dance – but not the fun kind. The tricky part is finding a betting buddy, and for wild predictions, that's like finding a needle in a haystack. Plus, you're locking up cash for the bet's duration – not exactly a money-saving hack.

**Equities: The Cool Cats**

Equities, on the other hand, are the cool cats. Positive sum markets! No need to hunt down naysayers; entrepreneurs find cheerleaders who want them to succeed. If they do, everyone's happy, and the stock dances to the market's tune.

Comparing prediction markets to equities is like comparing apples to rocket ships. Equities produce real value; prediction markets, not so much – unless you count the market price as a high-five. Winners in equities walk away with cash, losers just nod and move on. Prediction markets? Winners clutch cash, losers nurse their wounds.

**Positive-Sum Prediction Party? How?**

But wait, prediction markets are handy. They spill the beans on the likelihood of events – no matter how bizarre. So, what if we could turn them into a positive-sum party? Imagine more of these markets, predicting everything from the mainstream to the quirky. But how?

**Enter Provenance 2.0**

Imagine NFTs stepping into the prediction game. Yes, you heard it right – *Speculative Provenance*. Picture this: an artist predicts aliens visiting the Eiffel Tower on December 1st, 2025. Odds are crazier than a kangaroo on caffeine, and finding a bookmaker is like hunting unicorns.

The artist's lightbulb moment: paint that prediction. Ten paintings, to be exact. A journalist timestamps and authenticates the creation, buying one for $100. A reader jumps on the bandwagon, same price. The paintings hibernate.

December 1st, 2025 arrives, and voila! Alien craft, Eiffel Tower, midnight – the whole shebang. Now, the burning question: what's the price tag on those paintings?

Are they worth $100? Maybe $10,000? Heck, who knows? But if they're selling for more, the artist just hit the jackpot. They turned a wild prediction into equity in a moment – a positive-sum prediction market.

Now, let's ditch the paint and go digital. NFTs are the new canvas. Same timestamping magic, visible to the world, and tradable. Positive-sum prediction markets for anything and everything.

*Art Term Alert*: **Speculative Provenance Markets**. Art created to own the future.

Imagine searching for NFTs aligning with your predictions, trading them like stocks. Entities might specialize in crafting prediction NFTs with artistic flair – because, let's face it, fabulous art softens the blow if predictions flop. Maybe Falcons fans have NFTs of a Brady-less Superbowl comeback.

What happens when predictions go positive-sum? Do people team up to make dreams reality or stop nightmares? The crystal ball is foggy, but hey, let's run the experiment about this format's future success. Buckle up for the ride!
